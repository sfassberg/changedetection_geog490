#Detecting Change After the 2013 California Rim Fire

## By Sam Fassberg, Bowie Hutcheson, and Jasper Zhou

We are going to use Landsat-8 imagrey acquired from Google Earth API from before, after, and well after the California Rim Fire that happened in 2013. We are going to calculate NDVI, calculate + anaylze change in NDVI and NLCD, and visualize results on graphs and maps. 

**Objective:** We want to calculate the pixel change in NDVI and NLCD after the 2013 Rim Fire to see trends and potenital vegetation recovery.
