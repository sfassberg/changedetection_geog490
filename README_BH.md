Last three Questions:

* Expected outcomes: 
	* By calculating and comparing NDVI and vegetation change that the area surrounding the 2013 Rim Fire will show strong evidence of vegetation change. The changes that we expect to see are low vegetation health before the fire, low vegetation health after the fire, and better vegetation health after a long periods of time. 
	* In terms of pixel change, we expect to see more pixels classified as "healthy vegetation" in the imagery after the fire compared to vegetation pixels before the fire.

* Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.:
	* The imagery that is going to be used will be derived from Landsat remote sensing images that contain raster data. 
	* The images will be focused/cropped to fit the area of interest. In this case, the area burned from the 2013 Rim Fire in California. 
	* Change detection will be measured based on amounts of classified pixels that were lost/gained or changed to a different class over time. 

* References:
	* USGS (Landsat imagery)
	* Google Earth Engine
